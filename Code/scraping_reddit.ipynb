      "I’ve worked at Old Navy for five years and I know around three years ago the parent company GAP was caught using practically slave labor in some of the sweatshops where the clothes were made so GAP started to find higher quality sweatshops (if there is such a thing) and paid the workers a little more, which made prices higher and fabric quality lower to offset costs. I think GAP also tried really hard to appeal to the same kind of crowd Uniqlo drew in but never hit the mark on that stylish minimalism.\n",
      "***\n",
      "Yeah I've noticed this too. It sucks because ON and Gap used to be a good source for affordable tops made in natural fabrics (surprisingly hard to find in Canada). Nowadays everything is paper thin and poorly fitted. I do like ON jeans but find you need to try them on in stores because sizing, even between individual pairs in the same line, can be off.\n",

      "[deleted]\n",
      "***\n",
      "I had bought a pair of skinny jeans at GAP that I really liked and decided to go ahead and buy a couple more pairs in the exact same size and style the next time I went, but when I got home and tried them on they all turned out to be completely different sizes (despite being the same size numerically) and really poor quality. Also, I don’t feel like their clothes are priced appropriately given how cheaply manufactured they are now. Very sad.\n",
      "***\n",
      "Gap has been circling the drain for years. Most of the old box stores are because of how cost effective it is to just host an online shop. As quality degrades so do sales since people don't want stuff that just falls apart, resulting in a catch 22 of sorts. Really the quality is no better than walmart now and the styles are roughly as uninspiring.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I pretty much solely buy workout clothes and underwear from GAP these days. I go into the store *hoping* something will call to me... but then I just go to the back to the GapFit and GapBody sections\n",
      "***\n",
      "I think a couple things happened (I worked at Gap in the late 90s and early 2000s FYI) \n",
      "\n",
      "After the recession, stores got scared to take chances. The adorable enamel pins, skinny sequin scarves, bright corduroy peacoats and print tops with beaded details? OUT. Basic stuff that felt very unisex and safe was in. Well, so did every other mall store and Gap no longer felt unique and lost its voice. I always felt Gap was 60s and 70s influenced American sportswear. Preppy with a slight twist. It felt like they were going in the same direction as American Eagle, Aeropostale, Ann Taylor, etc. It just felt bland and middle of the road. \n",
      "\n",
      "The death spiral started. Not enough sales means hours cut and fewer people on the floor. Fewer people means disorganized and chaotic sales rooms/rounders and longer lines, and stores that felt empty and had no energy. That keeps people away and you get less sales. Even less hours to go around. Even crappier store upkeep. \n",
      "\n",
      "A Gap in an otherwise busy and luxury/high end mall I visited had two people working there: one was wearing pilled, faded leggings as pants and a grateful dead (!!) novelty sweater. When I worked at Gap it was Gap clothing or Gap-alike only and we were given generous discounts and incentives to dress the current styles. I recall being told to \"retire\" tired looking tees as a teen or being gently told something wasn't quite up to par. I'm sure the store managers and leaders have way, way bigger fish to fry now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sales. Customers expect near continuous cycle of sales now. Because Gap, BR, Old Navy, Ann Taylor, etc run a near constant 40-50% off sale, no one is paying full price anymore. So cash flow for fabric, workers, finishings, notions, and patterns is less. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gap and many other stores have cycled through a bunch of heads of design trying to find a voice/look. I can recall when Rebekka Bay was brought in and seeing her vision and thinking \"uh-oh\". Sure enough, she wound up [leaving after a short stint](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/30/gaps-creative-director-rebekka-bay-leaves-after-less-than-a-year)\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be an alchemy or magic about Gap in the late 90s but that was before the real surge of social media. Social media created this world where there's a demand for niche looks, highly trendy looks, statement looks, and highly photogenic, unique, and branded, easily recognizable looks. A basic Gap tee really isn't that different from Uniqlo, Muji, H&amp;M, or any other of thousands of retailers. Compare that to the inconic designer looks that dominate social media---you know a Gucci Dionysus bag when you see one, right? Same with a Supreme branded sweatshirt. Conformity and looking like everyone else is no longer a goal. Being mainstream and inoffensive with a slight pinch of salt/spice feels dated and none too youthful. \n",
      "\n",
      "I miss Gap and I miss being able to pop in there and pick up a handful of cute tees or some cool and trendy jeans. I miss working there! But yeah, it's not the same.\n",
      "***\n",
      "Gonna lead with an unpopular opinion here, but Gap is pretty decent for its price point. There’s a lot of basic stuff (linen or cotton button ups or popover shirts, basic jeans, basic pants, sweaters, Ts) plus some cuter things like dresses. I bought a pair of high rise crop flare jeans yesterday and they are really cute. The denim is pretty sturdy (high-ish cotton percentage) which i like. There are some cute linen crop flares right now. I shop at the gap fairly often and the quality is generally higher than H&amp;M or F21, in terms of stitching and cut and fit. Plus, whoever the hell is their size 4/27 fit model is my body twin, so I can order things online and count on them to fit me well. It’s not going to win any edgy fashion prizes, but it’s good wardrobe staple stuff for me. Their silhouettes are not as up to date on all items as they could be, but there is a variety of stuff that works well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sweatshop labor? Yes, it’s big international company. They basically all do that to some extent. Am I comfortable with that? No. Best solution? Quit shopping so damn much, but I never seem to accomplish that goal.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I miss the Modern Bootcut dress pants sooooo much. The fabric/cut prior to 2014(?), not the updated version. They were staples for me.\n",
      "***\n",
      "\"The styling back then was modern and basic with a twist, Gap kept up with some of the trends but was much more subdued than H&amp;M or Forever 21\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is so true, and I miss it. I really miss the stuff form the early 2000s.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I agree with you. It also seems like they don’t have much product. The GAP at my local mall used to have 3 entrances. Now, it condensed down into one of them and seems to have like one set of jeans, one set of sweaters to buy, etc. The last time I bought something in store was 2014. Shocking.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I feel the pain. I worked at Banana Republic from 06 to 09. The clothes were beautifully made, with classic styling from high-quality textiles and fine attention to detail. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today. I visited my old store after many years and I could not believe what was being carried. Thin, cheap fabrics, sloppy construction, literally like I was in a fast fashion store. Except they’re still charging Banana prices (although they do have a lot more sales now). It sounds trite but it was really depressing! I lurk on Poshmark for “vintage” BR now and have been able to purchase a few great items.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being that I was getting paid barely above minimum wage as an associate, I could only afford a few pieces even with the deep discount. I still have most of what I purchased and it’s just crazy comparing to what the brand offers today, or really any mall clothing store. Even my old F21 and Kohl’s clothing feels luxurious compared to the clothing in stores today.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I can’t stand all the stretchy synthetics in garments now. I have a few shirts that are literally like rubber bands.\n",
      "***\n",
      "1) You’ve grown up and so has your taste\n",
      "2) Notice the prices are pretty much the same as they were back when you shopped there? Only a few ways that can happen \n",
      "3) A lot of middle tier stores never fully rebounded from the recession\n",
      "***\n",
      "I stopped shopping at GAP in 2011 due to this. Everything I owned from there ripped or was defective. I tried it again once in 2017 and the dress I ordered arrived obscurely small, like the size of a doll - some kind of defect. Then tried again once in 2018 and the zipper broke in half the first time I zipped up. I'm done. GAP makes shitty clothes that drape like wrinkled tents.\n",
      "***\n",
      "There is nothing that Gap offers that I can’t get for cheaper at Old Navy.     \n",
      "Went to Gap to look for a pair of black biz casual work pants. They had one option. Old navy has six options.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I went into the GAP at Times Square last fall and I was so disappointed. The quality has definitely been on a downward spiral. Absolutely none of what was in the store appealed to me; it just looked boring and poorly constructed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have two pairs of Gap jeans from a decade ago that still fit and have held up rather well; the zipper broke on one but that’s the only thing, and I still wear that pair with longer tops. It used to be THE brand for me when I was in junior high and high school. My brother and I would get super-excited when we got packages from our aunt and we saw the iconic logo on the box. I remember being obsessed with the commercials and print ads too. The downgrade just makes me sad.\n",
      "***\n",
      "Gap is so great if you’re tall though. I finally picked up a pair of cropped wide legged jeans with a 30inch inseam. I was over the moon that I could get them. The sizing is ridiculous though. I think it’s vanity sizing. I got a size 28 and I have a 30 inch waist and a 40 inch hip. I’ll still have to get them tailored slightly. That’s outrageous. I’m def not a size 4. Old navy tall sizing sells out instantly. Every time I see something I like it’s gone immediately especially anything jogger style.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I could finally afford to go to GAP about a year ago.  I was struggling to find good jeans that fit well (I'm short) and I was tired of all of the \"Jeggings\" out there.  I had nothing to compare the quality to and I fell in love with the fit of the GAP jeans, but within a few months they formed a hole in the crotch. This has never been a problem for me even with cheap jeggings and for the amount I paid I'm still pissed. Back to trying to find real jeans that fit a short person.\n",
      "***\n",
      "I worked at Gap in college (late 90s/2000s).  The quality then was great and I still have clothes from that time I still wear (overalls).  I haven’t shopped there in 15 years probably.  They lost their way.\n",
      "***\n",
      "Are your favorite jeans the GAP Cone jeans? Those are my faves and they don’t make them anymore :((((\n",
      "***\n",
      "I read that management pushed out clothing styles against the advice of their designers. Former Gap Creative Director Rebekka Bay (now at Uniqlo IIRC but worked for Everlane) has spoken about this. Also read a statement that said to help themselves turn around they were going to focus on jeans and FLEECE. FLEECE? I wrote a case study about Gap for a term paper and it was incredibly frustrating seeing Gap just do whatever they wanted against the advice of customers and experts\n",
      "***\n",
      "Last time i bought anything gap was probably 2013, since then my sister has handed down two pairs of jeans that still hold up great and look perfect, that being said i haven't tried on one thing that looks or feels good since then\n",
      "***\n",

I think they lost a lot of their own customer base to Old Navy.

They also do a lot of 100% cotton or plant-based synthetics, which is rare among other companies in their price range. Go to Ann Taylor LOFT and everything is polyester and trendy-but-less-wearable cuts.

ON should open slightly below the current market price, but is expected to slightly outperform current GSP valuations and plateau around $17 per share.
